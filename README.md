# Topographic gradients of intrinsic dynamics across neocortex

This repository contains scripts, functions, and data I used or created in support of my work, ["Topographic gradients of intrinsic dynamics across neocortex"](https://elifesciences.org/articles/62116).
All analyses were run on Matlab version R2019a and Python version 3.7.

## `data`
The [data](data/) folder contains the data used to run the analyses. Specifically, it containes the processed group-average matrices from a subset of subjects in HCP. Note that HCP data redistribution must follow their [data terms](https://www.humanconnectome.org/study/hcp-young-adult/document/wu-minn-hcp-consortium-open-access-data-use-terms). If you use any of the HCP data, please note that you must register with ConnectomeDB, agree to their terms and sign up for Open Access Data [here](https://www.humanconnectome.org/study/hcp-young-adult/data-use-terms). Please also cite relevant publications as mentioned [here](https://www.humanconnectome.org/study/hcp-young-adult/document/wu-minn-hcp-consortium-open-access-data-use-terms).

The [data](data/) folder also contains required files to use and plot brain maps with [Schaefer atlas](https://github.com/ThomasYeoLab/CBIG/tree/master/stable_projects/brain_parcellation/Schaefer2018_LocalGlobal) as well as Evolutionary Expansion data from [Hill et al., 2010, PNAS](https://doi.org/10.1073/pnas.1001229107) originally available [here](https://github.com/PennLINC/Brain_Organization). Please cite relevant publications.
