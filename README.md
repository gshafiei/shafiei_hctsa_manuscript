# Topographic gradients of intrinsic dynamics across neocortex

This repository contains scripts, functions, and data I used or created in support of my work, ["Topographic gradients of intrinsic dynamics across neocortex"](https://elifesciences.org/articles/62116).
All analyses were run on Matlab version R2019a and Python version 3.7.
